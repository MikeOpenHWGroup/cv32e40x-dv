# Contributing
New Contributors are always welcome!
<br>
Althought most Contributors are [members](https://www.openhwgroup.org/membership/) of the
OpenHW Group and participate in one or more [Technical Task Groups](https://www.openhwgroup.org/working-groups/),
membership is not required to be an active Contributor.

## Contributor Agreement
All Contributors must be covered by the terms of the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php)
(for individuals) **or** the [Eclipse Member Committer and Contributor Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/committer_process/EclipseMemberCommitterAgreement.pdf)
(for employees of Member companies). The ECA/MCCA provides a legal
framework for a Contributor's technical contributions to the OpenHW Group,
including provisions for grant of copyright license and a Developer
Certificate of Origin on contributions merged into OpenHW Group repositories.

## The Mechanics
1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [cv32e40x-dv](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40x-dv) repository
2. Clone your forked repository: `git clone https://github.com/[your_github_username]/cv32e40x-dv`
3. Checkout the correct branch reflecting the nature of your contribution.  Nearly all contributions should target a _dev_ branch.
4. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b <my_branch>.`<br> Please uniquify your branch name.  See the [Git Cheats](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/blob/master/GitCheats.md) on the CORE-V-VERIF repo for a useful nominclature.
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
6. Push feature branch: `git push origin <my_branch>`
7. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
